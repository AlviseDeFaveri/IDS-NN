# IDS-NN
*Network Intrusion Detection System realized using a simple neural network.*

The NN provides a binary classification for connections by labeling them as *normal* or *anomalous*. Training and testing is performed on the NSL-KDD dataset. A detailed analysis is provided in the `IDS_NN.pdf` file.

`src/` contains the Jupyter Notebook code used for preparing the dataset and training the models (Keras + Tensorflow).

`report/` contains the LaTeX code for the report.
